v0.0.1 - 16 April 2024
-----------------------
    - Fixed issues with csv output (it didn't exist)
    - Include 'status' field in the listing output
    - Fixed an issue when adding comments where we could
      accidentally add all whitespace as comment.
    - Querying for issues first grabs the final states that
      the JIRA server has configured, and then uses those to
      check for closed issues, rather than hardcoded string.
    - Added a command to output the final states so that future
      query building can use them
    - Added the option for interactive shell mode when click-shell
      package is installed.
    - Added state transitions.
    - Bug fixes.
